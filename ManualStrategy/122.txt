Knowledge:

develop a trading strategy --> intuition and technical analysis

test ---> market simulator

later project ---> using machine learning to create a trading strategy

Template::

1. manual_strategy.py
2. util.py
3. ML4T/Data directory but you should use ONLY the API functions in utils.py

Submission:

1. inditcator.py   ---> generate the charts that illustrate your indicators in the report
2. marketsimcode.py  ---> An improved version of your marketsim code that accepts trades data

---> trade data

3. ManualStrategy.py   ---> manual strategy ---> testPolicy() which returns a trades data frame

4. Theoretically OptimalStrategy.py

----> OptimalStrategy.py


Part I:

1. Develop and describe at least 3 and at most 5 technical indicators. 
---> lecture on time series processing to be helpful
---> each indicator has to be described by compeling figures
---> report for each indicator should enable others to reproduce it by reading the description.
---> details in writing, we can use Pseudocode figure to illustrate.
---> at least one indicator should be different than SMA, Bollinger bands, RSI


Part II:

1. CONSTRAINTS : portfolio size and order limits ---> 10000

---> create a set of trades that represents the best strategy could possible do during the in sample preiod
